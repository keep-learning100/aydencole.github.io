I started programming in high school with Zed Shaw's classic *Learn Python the Hard Way.* I remember spending countless hours building a simple choose-your-own-adventure game to play in your terminal. 

Although I enjoyed reading programming and reading the latest posts on *The Verge* every day, I didn't consider it for a career path at the time. My main focus was finding a role where I could help people. For that reason, when I graduated high school I directed my college studies towards a psychology degree, and afterward worked in a variety of mental health and healthcare environments.

My last healthcare role was at Compass Oncology. A developed a lot of strong connections with the patients there, some of whom were kind of enough to pass their wisdom along. One thing I heard often was to enjoy my life, because it's too short. Somewhere along the way, I remembered that build-your-own-adventure game from high school and I wondered if tech might be something I'd enjoy.

I sustained a concussion on an adventure at Mt. Hood during the summer of 2025. I had to take a chunk of time off work. Against my doctor's advice, I started an online cybersecurity course (*Cisco Introduction to Cybersecurity*) and I was immediately obssessed with it. 

I gave three month's notice at work, and during that time I knocked out *Google's Cybersecurity Professional Certificate*. Leaving my job provided an abundance of time. I watched all of Professor Messer's videos on the CompTIA A+. Then I studied for, tried, and passed the CompTIA Network+ and Security+.

After that, I spoke with a mentor with experience in cybersecurity who recommended I get a job at an MSP and find in person meetups. I got a part time job at *Omnivir*, where I was able to work on traffic counters, printers, servers, and more.

After a few months, I was itching to do more work than a part time job could provide, so I left *Omnivir* and went full time on my own. **Please request me on Field Nation (ID: 1064310) if you need need help with any IT related gigs!**

That's a little bit about me. As of February 2026, I'm working on my PNPT (Practical Network Penetration Tester), and hope to pass it this Spring. Once I've learned to see through the eyes of an attacker better, I will go back to learning blue team, which is my favorite. I also intend to start putting some video tutorials out before March rolls around... stay tuned!
