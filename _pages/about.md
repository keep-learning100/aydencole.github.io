I am becoming a cybersecurity professional and documenting my progress in this blog along the way. My interest in technology stems from my background in psychology. Majoring in psychology gave me a deep appreciation for the unique risks and vulnerabilities of the human brain system. Given that the most common attack vectors are and likely always will be human, I believe that understanding our weaknesses has enormous relevance to a good defensive strategy online and in the cloud. This is especially the case with the advent of Generative AI, as a firm understanding of the similarities and differences between human consciousness and AI will be essential to help us guard our data and systems.

Right now, I have completed Cisco's "Introduction to Cybersecurity" course and Google's Cybersecurity Certificate. I am currently preparing to take the CompTIA Network+ and the CompTIA Security+.

Here are some of the tools I am using to help me learn.

* GROK A.I.
* Kali Linux
* Python
* SQL

I try to post every day. This website is a lab in and of itself, so I can test best security principles in real life. I would love your input if you see something I could do better or if you have any questions. Please feel free to reach out through any of the socials provided on my main page, including X and Instagram.
