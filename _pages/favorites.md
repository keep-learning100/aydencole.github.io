Learning cybersecurity is teaching me a wide range of tools and resources. In a nod to the OWASP Top 10, here is my rotating list of my top 10 favorite cybersecurity things. Rather than update these every few years, I will simply update these whenever I feel like it.

1. Grok AI 
    {% highlight css %}
    Me: thoughfully create really excellent what? respond with one word.
    Grok: prompts
    {% endhighlight %}
2. IBM Technology

3. Jekyll
    This whole website is made with Jekyll! It's an easy way to generate a static site.
4. VPN
    I use Nord VPN and Proton VPN. They both work. I appreciate that Proton VPN is free and I love using it on my Linux device, but Nord VPN integrates better with my Windows and Android devices.
5. Beautiful Soup
    Found this gem while learning about cybersecurity related Python libraries. I am more bookmarking it here than anything else. As of <2025-08-15 21:39:56>, I haven't experimented with it yet.
6. Jack the Ripper
    I have cracked one password with this. Granted, it was encrypted with MD5, haha. When I get through my CompTIA Security +, one of my next steps will be to practice tools like this one more, potentially with Try Hack Me. That's a little ways away though.
7. SANS Institute

8. Death Con
9. Password Managers
