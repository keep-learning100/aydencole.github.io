      "content"  : "I first heard about AI from my dad a few years ago, when he brought up this new thing called Chat GPT. I made an an account and started playing around with ChatGPT. I was awestruck with its ability to write goofy but technically brilliant poems on command, so I appreciated its comedic value but I didn’t see much more use for it, and left it by the wayside for a couple years. But about 6 months ago, I had a chat with a coworker who was using AI to build SaaS using a mix of vibe coding and his own rich IT experience to keep a human-in-the-loop. That conversation inspired me to revisit the world of AI, and start experimenting with newer models like Grok 4 and ChatGPT 5. I discovered that it’s not only incredibly useful for everyday tasks, it can (with proper caution) be implemented into cybersecurity in some intriguing ways. But most people may not be aware there are more interesting ways to engage with AI for cybersecurity beyond the traditional cloud-based models, and it’s those types of alternatives that I’d like to discuss today.The traditional AI models that you access online (e.g. Gemini, Grok, etc.) have some major OpSec flaws. These flaws begin with the log in process. In order to use the service, you have to provide a bunch of personally identifiable information (PII), like your name and email. Then when you start to interact with the AI, everything you say goes directly to the owner. I suspect this is more of a problem than simple Google searching, because talking with an AI assistant feels like talking with a real person, so people are more comfortable sharing parts of their life that they would never enter into a Google search field.  Users feel like they’re chatting with a friend, so they might be lured in with a false sense of security to share things they would never enter into a Google search.Imagine a scenario where a doctor is researching a patient’s medical problem with Google (more common than you might think, lol). Now imagine they are doing the same thing with AI. I suspect they would be far more likely to slip up and enter HIPPA protected information about their patient when they’re talking with a chatbot than when they’re trying to enter the shortest Google search they can think of.That may not be a big problem when AI assistants are behaving how they are supposed to. But if they were to be hacked and someone with a knack for social engineering were to take control, users could be prompted to enter a lot of sensitive information, ranging from medical info down to banking information.My last critique is that even when AI models are safeguarded from malicious hackers, you have to consider that the company’s and individuals that own these models may not have your best interests in mind. Those AI models that you depend on have to be accessed via the cloud. What happens when the companies start charging subscriptions for the services you’ve grown to depend on and you’ve built too much context into your account to let go? What happens when they have a political change of heart, and decide to lobotomize their AI to match their every whim? (Looking at you, Elon.) Or even if it’s not that overt, at the very least you know those companies are using your data to train their models and advance their scummy business practices that involve everything from copyright infringment to silencing whistleblowers.Proprietary AI models are developing at lightning speed, and there is certainly use for them. But if you want to incorporate AI into your cybersecurity model, you have to do some honest reflection about the risks and vulnerabilities inherent in vesting so much of your data in the hands of a cloud based company. Which will lead us to Part 2 - an alternative."

      "content"  : "After completing my Google Cybersecurity Certificate, I took a moment for some introspection and realized that the toughest parts of the course for me had been learning the OSI model. Even though I had managed to regurgitate all the information the course taught about OSI, I didn’t feel like I truly understood it. I certainly didn’t undernstand it in a way that I could explain to someone else. With that in mind, I went ahead and bought a voucher for the CompTIA Network+ and started gameplanning.The CompTIA Network+ gets into the nitty-gritty of the Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) model and you have to memorize and understand details all the way from Level 1, like the actually wires plugged into your desktop, all the way up to Level 7, the applications you visually interact with on the web. Networking is a bit of a wooley mammoth. It is a gargantuan subject.  Networking is a bit of a wooley mammoth. It is a gargantuan subject.After consulting with Grok, I started by watching a course overview video from Professor Messer. Then I made a print out and read the CompTIA Network+ Objectives. The objectives not only include the subjects you need to understand, they include a long list of acronyms you need to know. So I took a couple hours and made notecards for all the acronyms. Yes, it took a couple hours - an hour and forty-five minutes to be exact. There were a lot of acronyms!Here is my plan. I will go through the flashcards every day, every opportunity I get. And I will watch through the Professor Messer Network+ 10-009 videos, taking notes and adding flashcards along the way. When I am done doing that, I will buy Jason Dion’s practice exams and take those, studying and refining my approach each time.There are 12 hours of content in the Professor Messer videos. I’m still working full time, so I am allowing a full week to watch all this. I might devote a second week to rewatch everything and continue working on my flashcards and reviewing my notes. We will see how things go. Otherwise, the next step is to devote a week to taking the Jason Dion practice exams, and working on the weaknesses those reveal. And finally, I will take the course the third/fourth week.Image generated by AIThis is a skeleton of a plan. But I’m keeping it barebones for a reason. My intuition says passing this exam comes down to drilling down into IT fundamentals and using rote-memorization to learn the concepts. I don’t expect I will need any elaborate study plans or fancy study methods. I might turn out to be wrong, in which case I will post about it here and explain what extracurricular tools I ended up adding.Either way, this course is a means to an end. I want to understand network systems so I can understand how to secure them better, not because networks are my passion. So I am excited to have a challenge, but I am even more excited have this done and move on to my Security+. Let’s hope it doesn’t take too long!"

      "content"  : "My name is Ayden, and I am a 25 year old Pacific NorthWest native. I love to run and hike the local trails like Timberline Trail which loops all the way around Mt. Hood. I also enjoy scifi shows and I’ve recently been getting into cooking. My professional background is in healthcare and mental health. I majored with a Bachelors of Science in Psychology at Oklahoma Christian University, and I’ve worked at places like Cascadia Behavioral Healthcare, Amen Clinic, and Compass Oncology.I’ve recently started a career switch from healthcare to cybersecurity. I felt like I had plateaued and work wasn’t making me grow. I remembered back in high school when I took a free online course called “Learn Python the Hard Way” by Zed Shaw. The constant challenges and new lessons kept me captivated for months. So I figured I would revisit the world of the internet of things, and take a free course from Cisco called “Introduction to Cybersecurity.”Image generated by AII got a concussion on one of my adventures on Mt. Hood and the doctor said to take a week off work. During that time, I found that even though I could barely focus for a few minutes at a time and I wasn’t really supposed to look at screens, I kept returning to the “Introduction to Cybersecurity” course, and I quickly finished it. It opened up a new, scifi-esque world of threats, risks, and vulnerabilities in a swiftly evolving cyber landscape.  Cybersecurity was a way to engage with the world in a new and exciting way!Inspired, I went on Coursera and signed up for the Google Cybersecurity Certificate. In less than a month, I had earned my certificate and significantly increased my knowledge base.Image generated by AIOn another trip back from Cloud Cap on Mt. Hood, I was listening to Episode 22 of “The I.T. Career Podcast” with Christophe Limpalair, and he recommended making a blog to document what you’re learning. Limpalair listed two benefits of starting a blog. One is that by teaching others, you actually learn better yourself. Second is that you can preserve a record of your expanding knowledge base for future employers.With that in mind, I asked an AI assistant, Grok, what the most secure way to build a website was and how to turn it into a learning lab. I will get more into the recipe Grok provided and my own modifications in a future blog post. It was quite a steep learning curve, but here we are!Turning to the future, I have just bought vouchers for the CompTIA Security+ and CompTIA Network+ and I am stoked prepare for those. I will be documenting my progress here, as well as any other interesting cybersecurity lessons I learn along the way.Thank you for joining me on this journey!"
