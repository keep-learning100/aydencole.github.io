                <title>Getting Started on Network Plus</title>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;After completing my Google Cybersecurity Certificate, I took a moment for some introspection and realized that the toughest parts of the course for me had been learning the OSI model. Even though I had managed to regurgitate all the information the course taught about OSI, I didn’t feel like I truly understood it. I certainly didn’t undernstand it in a way that I could explain to someone else. With that in mind, I went ahead and bought a voucher for the CompTIA Network+ and started gameplanning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The CompTIA Network+ gets into the nitty-gritty of the Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) model and you have to memorize and understand details all the way from Level 1, like the actually wires plugged into your desktop, all the way up to Level 7, the applications you visually interact with on the web. Networking is a bit of a wooley mammoth. It is a gargantuan subject.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Networking is a bit of a wooley mammoth. It is a gargantuan subject.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After consulting with Grok, I started by watching a course overview video from Professor Messer. Then I made a print out and read the CompTIA Network+ Objectives. The objectives not only include the subjects you need to understand, they include a long list of acronyms you need to know. So I took a couple hours and made notecards for all the acronyms. Yes, it took a couple hours - an hour and forty-five minutes to be exact. There were a lot of acronyms!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is my plan. I will go through the flashcards every day, every opportunity I get. And I will watch through the Professor Messer Network+ 10-009 videos, taking notes and adding flashcards along the way. When I am done doing that, I will buy Jason Dion’s practice exams and take those, studying and refining my approach each time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are 12 hours of content in the Professor Messer videos. I’m still working full time, so I am allowing a full week to watch all this. I might devote a second week to rewatch everything and continue working on my flashcards and reviewing my notes. We will see how things go. Otherwise, the next step is to devote a week to taking the Jason Dion practice exams, and working on the weaknesses those reveal. And finally, I will take the course the third/fourth week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a skeleton of a plan. But I’m keeping it barebones for a reason. My intuition says passing this exam comes down to drilling down into IT fundamentals and using rote-memorization to learn the concepts. I don’t expect I will need any elaborate study plans or fancy study methods. I might turn out to be wrong, in which case I will post about it here and explain what extracurricular tools I ended up adding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Either way, this course is a means to an end. I want to understand network systems so I can understand how to secure them better, not because networks are my passion. So I am excited to have a challenge, but I am even more excited have this done and move on to my Security+. Let’s hope it doesn’t take too long!&lt;/p&gt;

                <title>Hello World!</title>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;My name is Ayden, and I am a 25 year old Pacific NorthWest native. I love to run and hike the local trails like Timberline Trail which loops all the way around Mt. Hood. I also enjoy scifi shows and I’ve recently been getting into cooking. My professional background is in healthcare and mental health. I majored with a Bachelors of Science in Psychology at Oklahoma Christian University, and I’ve worked at places like Cascadia Behavioral Healthcare, Amen Clinic, and Compass Oncology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve recently started a career switch from healthcare to cybersecurity. I felt like I had plateaued and work wasn’t making me grow. I remembered back in high school when I took a free online course called “Learn Python the Hard Way” by Zed Shaw. The constant challenges and new lessons kept me captivated for months. So I figured I would revisit the world of the internet of things, and take a free course from Cisco called “Introduction to Cybersecurity.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/08.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Dark Brain&quot; style=&quot;width: 100%; height: auto;&quot; /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I got a concussion on one of my adventures on Mt. Hood and the doctor said to take a week off work. During that time, I found that even though I could barely focus for a few minutes at a time and I wasn’t really supposed to look at screens, I kept returning to the “Introduction to Cybersecurity” course, and I quickly finished it. It opened up a new, scifi-esque world of threats, risks, and vulnerabilities in a swiftly evolving cyber landscape.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Cybersecurity was a way to engage with the world in a new and exciting way!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Inspired, I went on Coursera and signed up for the Google Cybersecurity Certificate. In less than a month, I had earned my certificate and significantly increased my knowledge base.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On another trip back from Cloud Cap on Mt. Hood, I was listening to Episode 22 of “The I.T. Career Podcast” with Christophe Limpalair, and he recommended making a blog to document what you’re learning. Limpalair listed two benefits of starting a blog. One is that by teaching others, you actually learn better yourself. Second is that you can preserve a record of your expanding knowledge base for future employers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With that in mind, I asked an AI assistant, Grok, what the most secure way to build a website was and how to turn it into a learning lab. I will get more into the recipe Grok provided and my own modifications in a future blog post. It was quite a steep learning curve, but here we are!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Turning to the future, I have just bought vouchers for the CompTIA Security+ and CompTIA Network+ and I am stoked prepare for those. I will be documenting my progress here, as well as any other interesting cybersecurity lessons I learn along the way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you for joining me on this journey!&lt;/p&gt;
